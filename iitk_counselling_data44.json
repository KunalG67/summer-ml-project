    "content": "Quoting our alumni, âOrientation is one of the best memories of IITK.\" The Institute Counselling Service conducted a 11-day long Orientation for the new Freshers batch to help them get acclimatized to campus and bond with their batchmates. It is the largest College Orientation programme in the nation. Students are introduced to Academic Structure, Administrative Structure, Students' Gymkhana, Clubs & Societies and the various opportunities IITK has for its students. Orientation also contains games, wing activities, interactive sessions and a campus tour with the aim to nurture the newly formed bonds among the students. Memories made here stay forever.\nWorld Suicide Prevention Day is an awareness day observed on 10 September every year to provide worldwide commitment and action to prevent suicide with various activities worldwide since 2003. IIT Kanpur also organises events every year to raise awareness that suicide is preventable and to decrease stigma regarding suicide. This year the Institute Counselling Service conducted a seminar, which included a talk by the renowned psychiatrist of Kanpur, Dr Kalim Ahmed.\nOn the occasion of mental health day, the Institute Counselling Service conducted various inspiring events to bring attention to Mental health wellness. A Mental health awareness talk was organised to have an open interaction of the campus community with the counsellors to share their thoughts and learn about the importance of mental health in a person's life. There were many fun activities for the audience to have fun while learning to take care of their mental health. The session was followed by a movie screening of \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", which portrays the life of a teenager & his struggles with his post-traumatic stress disorder as he goes through his journey in high school.\nEvery year on Diwali, we organize 'Hakuna Matata'. Since many students celebrate Diwali away from home, we take the initiative of making students feel at \"Home away from Home\" by conducting various fun-filled activities to engage the students in positive gainful activities and let off steam under Hakuna Matata. This year, the celebration included a Rangoli Competition in collaboration with the Fine Arts Club. Following this, the day ended with students flying Sky Lanterns and decorating the ground with Diyas marking the Festival of lights.\nAcademic Remedial classes, otherwise known as AM Classes, are sessions organised to cover the syllabus of the first year courses and to gear up the students for upcoming exams. These classes are meant to clear any doubts, solve questions and cover the course content concisely and clearly from an exam point of view. These sessions are headed by Academic Mentors who also prepare short notes and discuss questions keeping in mind the past year's question trends.\nA 5km Run and Walk event with the theme \"Run and Walk for a Cause\" was also held for the campus community to spirit up the mental health day and bring the attention of the importance of mental health. The Marathon started at OAT and continued all through the Campus. Goodies, along with energy drinks, were also distributed to the participants."

Seniors from various departments who have had pursued research internships, management internships or core or noncore internships during their summers, illuminate their juniors with the myriad opportunities present out there.\nThe dynamics of relationships amidst which one lives are complex in nature. We aim to help students understand and unwind the complications of these through this session.\nStudents are focused on improving their study techniques in order to optimize their skill set to the maximum. The session on study techniques is aimed at acquainting students on various studying approaches which can be helpful for them in regularizing their studies and performing better in their examinations.\nOne of the most pressing issues in the campus for Undergraduate and Postgraduate students is how to spend time on the right things and in the right places. We try to help students in reaching out to their priorities, obligations and schedule so that they benefit in all areas of life through this session.\nAimed at helping the students understand the various forms of addiction and sensitize them on ways to overcome them."

    "content": "Addiction can be confusing. Especially when one isn't sure if engagement with some substances or activities is just curiosity, necessity or compulsion.\n                                Such habits can be notorious in the sense of causing more harm than one realizes.\nAnd by the time one does, a lot of harm has already been done to the person, their future, and aspirations.\nCounselling Service invited Dr. Vivek Benegal from NIMHANS to help us understand addictive behaviors better so that we are equipped to know how to help ourselves and people we care about while dealing with addictive substances and habits.\nIt is important for us to come together to prevent our friends from taking any untoward step.\n                          We often fail unwittingly, to lend a helping hand in their hour of distress, because more often than not, we are incapable of recognising the symptoms and hence are unable to provide the necessary support.\nIt is also crucial for people to realise that they will find help, if only they would seek it.\n                          The aim of the panel discussion, âHolding on to the Lightâ, is to raise awareness about this issue and also to look for possible solutions.\n                          Because, in an inclusive society, suicide prevention is everyoneâs responsibility.\nCounselling Service brings to you \"From LOST to FOUND\" the first program, underÂ SAMVAD, for this semester.\n                        SAMVADÂ as a mental health initiative recognizes stories and narratives as powerful ways of connecting people through their struggles and their success.\n                        Margaret Atwood said that \"In the end, we'll all become stories\". However, people who chose to share their stories are also sharing their truths, their light, their courage, and their warmth with whoever might need it. By owning their stories, they are also accepting themselves, celebrating their struggles, owning their failures, and shaping their future.\n\n                        From LOST to FOUND is bringing stories of people from the community, for the community, with the intentions of building empathetic and nurturing spaces at IITK. Join us for an interactive session to celebrate the struggles of everyday living and contribute to each other's ways of living life with respect, dignity, and courage.\n\n                        \nDate: 20th January 2020\nTime: 6:15 PM\nVenue: L-17\n                        Tea will be served at 6 p.m.\nQ. I think I am a good listener. However, when someone expresses an opinion on a situation that is totally contrasting to me â I have this bias that this person is overthinking or thinking wrongly of the situation; and that results in expressing my opinion too â leading to a poor conversation. How do you, as a counselor, practice to keep your bias totally aside?\n                      You bring in a lot of self-awareness with your question.\n                      Counsellorsâ education and training improve their communication skills and allow them to practice empathy along with maintaining their rationality.\n                      On a general level, learning assertive communication skills might be useful to maintain a good conversation. Using the given communication style, a person can learn to express their thoughts and feeling without coming across as too aggressive or too passive to others.\n                      HowQ. to realize that weâre âworthyâ of it? How could one be âwhat you want to beâ retaining what âyou originally areâ?\n                      \n                      Being worthy of a meaningful, happy, and satisfying life is the goal of human existence. Things/people/experiences which make you question your worth and your happiness need to be questioned themself.\n                      The second part of the question compares future âselfâ with the present âselfâ. It relates to the underlying insecurities and fear which any life changes bring about. You can understand it in this way that the â5-year younger youâ is not the same as âthe present youâ. In the same way, âthe future youâ will also be different. Although, you are one person, and what connects them is âbeing you.â When you develop an awareness of âwho I amâ as a person, then external changes will only be able to bring external effects, and internally it will be the same âyouâ who has gone through these changes.\n\n                      Q.\n                        I have a wingie from a reserved category who has a very low CPI < 4 after the third semester. He is facing Academic Probation. He has lied to his parents about his CPI. He is currently participating in Galaxy(dance). He does not talk with anybody from the wing (from the beginning). What do you think should be done to help him? Do you think it is necessary for the counselling service or the Institute to prevent such people from participating in cultural events as their CPI is low? Or do you think something can be done to do the above-mentioned activities? Please give a realistic response.   Your question reflects a lot of concern and good intentions on your part. For your wingie, 1. Academic help can be provided to him through academic mentors or TAs. 2. As per the Institute policy, if a student is in 'Academic Probation' or 'Warningâ, they can not hold any ' Position Of Responsibility'. 3. If a student does not want to take part in some hall level event/activity but is being forced by seniors or peers, one can inform his Student Guide, counsellor, Head of Counselling Service, DOSA, or Hall warden. He will be exempted from taking part in the event. However, if a person is extremely motivated to take part in some co-curricular activity and is unable to make the balance between academics and co-curricular activities, then he has to work on his 'Time Management' . Attending regular classes and a few hours of self-study may help him.\n\n                          Q. How do you overcome the feeling of loss of interest in doing basic routine daily life? How do you cope up with the constant thoughts of what shall I do to be happy in a depression period? How to cope with this if the person gets diagnosed with depression with anxiety and panic attacks behavioral problems?Â   Losing interest in doing basic routine daily life is signs and symptoms of depression and with the help of psychological intervention, a person can improve their interest in doing things.Â  It is like a process to work on that to develop interest in daily activities in collaboration with the therapist and client. There is no specific way to be happy during a depression period. During that period a person goes through negative automatic thoughts about the self,future and sometimes about the world. So during this time a professional counselor or therapist can help a person to live in a normal way. If a person is diagnosed with depression itâs difficult for the person to cope up with the depression, but with the help of medication and psychotherapy and counseling a person with depression can cope up and lead a normal life.\n\n                          Q. It happens very often to me that I am doing something and my mind is not there. Basically I loose focus and concentration while I know this type of behaviour will cause difficulty to my life, mostly , to my studies. Please suggest something about it.Â   Thank you for sharing your problem with us. There can be many ânâ number of variables which are contributing to your problem. It can be boredom or lack of interest in the work or studies or maybe you are finding the subject difficult, also it reflects your mental state, which can also be the reason behind impaired concentration and attention. In my opinion, Mindfulness based therapies will help you in resolving your problem. You are most welcome to Counselling service.\n\n                          Q. Suppose if you have sought changes thinking for your good.You try doing right things and one after another things keep going on wrong no matter how you try. How should one keep himself/herself emotionally & mentally stable in that case?  There are many times in our lives we donât get desired outcomes . Sometimes , introspection helps, sometimes accepting things as they are makes yourself stable.Â  You should work on your coping mechanism and a professional psychologist can also help you with this."

    "content": "Counselling is not the same as giving advice. It is quite different from the general opinion held by people. Going for a counselling session in no way indicates that you are helpless or incapable of solving your problems. By talking about your problems or concerns with a counsellor you will deepen your understanding of your problem and develop the means to deal with them. We are happy to talk over any of your problems and with your agreement may refer you to other sources who might be able to help better such as psychiatrists or doctors.\nAll registered undergraduate and postgraduate students can avail the service free of cost. The expenditure involved if you wish to see the psychiatrist is also borne by the service.\nYou can contact the team members by seeing us in person, making a telephone call or mail-anything you are comfortable with. Click here to see the list of contacts.\nIt doesn't really matter how you present your problem.You can say whatever you like. Sometimes there is silence, sometimes you might find yourself saying things you had not expected to say. The counsellor will help you explore the matter and will keep referring to you to clarify his/her understanding.\nYou can come to us for academic problems, emotional issues, career awareness and financial difficulties. These may include stress related problems, exam anxiety, personal problems and career related queries.\nMany of our problems arise just because we are human.We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. No. Counselling is based in the belief that most people naturally strive to make the best use of themselves. When something goes wrong, it is usually because we are pushing ourselves too hard; because we are in a muddle for reasons we don't fully understand or because we are actually are suffering some form of mental distress which is distorting our view of reality. Therefore judging is not helpful or relevant; they need to be supported in finding their own way out of the problem.\nWe all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. Needing help is a normal part of this process. You could only label it as failure if you had already decided you must succeed entirely on our own - which is not a burden you have to impose on yourself. If you think you've failed, the counsellor might help you see that this is not all there is to it.\nParadoxically it can be seen as a matter of strength to ask for counselling. Many people think that they are being strong in not seeking help whereas in fact those who can admit to their difficulties could be considered the strong ones. Asking for counselling often mean you have taken the first difficult step on the road to resolving the problem.\nCounsellors do accept that it is natural to want to appear successful and that most of us feel some shame when we have problems and so don't want to advertise our difficulties. This is one of the reasons we place a great emphasis on confidentiality.\nStrict confidentiality is ensured in the Institute Counselling Service.\nIf a student approaches the Institute Counselling Service, nothing about it will go on his record.\nNo, but it seems to offer at least some help to the majority so is worth a try.\nCounselling bears little relation to psychiatry except that both deal with emotional and mental processes. Psychiatrist are trained doctors, who work largely through diagnosis of illness and then by prescribing a treatment - usually involving medication. Counsellors are normally non-medical personnel who work by talking and encouraging you to find your own solutions. Counsellors can however recognize the symptoms of severe mental distress, and may suggest you to consider medical help if seems appropriate.\nIf you want to approach us regarding a friend, you are most welcome. We'll try our best to help you in helping your friend.\nRemedial Classes are meant to clarify the basic concepts. It is possible that all intricacies and details as taught by the professor are not taught. However the underlying concepts are fully covered in a much simpler manner, on the basis of which further study can be done.\nNo, the remedial class are just a help provided when there is difficulty in grasping the concepts in college lectures. They may not cover the entire syllabus(only the difficult parts) and are sometimes not as regular as college lectures.\nAnytime, when the mentor is free. It depends on mutual understanding between the mentor and student. The mentor can be contacted via phone or other means, and unless he is in the middle of something very important, he is willing to help out.\nNot at all! It is always possible to miss out on certain concepts while in class or during self study and the academic load may make us all feel pressurized at times. Therefore, asking for help doesn't undermine your intelligence or your capabilities, but only demonstrates your willingness to learn.\nStudents of only UG and M.Sc. programs can apply for scholarships. Other programs are not eligible for scholarships.\nStudents who are unable to get financial support from the institute or from any other source.\nThe following criteria are evaluated for awarding SBF scholarships:\n                    \nParental income\nCPI\nStudent should not be getting financial support from any other source\nStudents can apply for SBF by filling an online form which is circulated by the Institute Counselling Service around mid-September. Whenever the form link is active, a mail is sent to the students' mailing list.\nYou can get Merit-cum-Means scholarship, Sports scholarship, various Donor Departmental scholarships, and Basic Mess & Pocket Allowance."

    "content": "Different students have different ways of studying. Some are able to perform and understand better by covering current subjects in small amounts on a regular basis in accordance with class, while some others find it convenient to study in bulk say at the end of the week or so. You should try figure out which way suits you better. In case you can not come to a conclusion, we suggest you to follow the first approach of studying in small amounts on a regular basis.\nIdentify Best Time for Studying: Everyone has high and low periods of attention and concentration. Figure out are you a morning person or a night person. Use your power times to study and the down times for routines.\nWrite down what you have to do, when and then prioritize. Maintaining a schedule can make you feel more in control.\nIdentify the place of study that suites you most, avoiding distractions, be it the library or the comfort of your room.\nYou should constantly motivate yourself\nReward yourself when you have achieved some goal.\nTry not to overburden yourself by unnecessarily comparing yourself with others.\nTake regular, short breaks when you are working - for example, some students find it better to study for an hour or so and then relax for 10 mins. This helps to concentrate for longer. Rather than studying throughout the night in library without enough concentration, itâs better to focus your attention and study effectively for a shorter period of time.If you are finding it very difficult to concentrate, start off by setting yourself a small, manageable goal. When you have achieved this, give yourself some reward. Keep repeating this process. As you achieve your goals, gradually increase what you set out to do. In this way you can train yourself to concentrate more effectively.\nTake regular, short breaks when you are working - for example, some students find it better to study for an hour or so and then relax for 10 mins.

And list the important points that can be reviewed later.\n Speak out loud.\n Mix topics frequently. Mix easy and difficult topics, and interesting and dull topics.\n Seek help from the seniors who had already done that course, you can learn from their experience and their mistakes.\n Discuss your doubts with your friends, this will help you in better understanding the topic.\nIf you still have doubts feel free to approach your instructor/tutor. Just mail them and ask for some suitable time to meet them.\nImproving the study habits also help in concentrating better. Here are a few tips:\nEveryone in this class is smarter and faster than I am.\n I always mess up on quizzes.\n If I don't do well on this exam, then I'll get an F in the course.\n This is the worst course.\n\n\n                    Become aware of what you say to yourself. Try writing your negative thoughts and then disputing each one with a positive statement like Even if I am afraid, I will do everything I can to overcome any obstacle in order to achieve my goals Encourage yourself, as you would have done to a friend. Repeating your positive statements to yourself will help reprogram your mind for success instead of for failure. In case you still find it difficult to get rid of these thoughts or feelings please feel free to contact our counsellors who might be able to help you better.\nInstitute level Remedial classes are organized by the Institute Counselling Service in order to provide help in understanding courses and clearing doubts, if any.

    "content": "Anxiety is a normal emotional and physiological response to feeling threatened. People differ as to how vulnerable they feel in different situations: this can be influenced by past experiences as well as by the beliefs and attitudes they hold about these situations.\nIt is a cliche that we can feel lonely - even particularly lonely - in a crowd. Unfortunately it is one that is only too true and all too common at university. Here, surrounded by people of a similar age and, supposedly, with lots in common we can nevertheless feel wretchedly isolated and awkward. This is made worse by the sight of others who seem perfectly at ease, are rapidly making friends and are becoming embedded in groups from which you feel excluded or only tolerated on the margins.Feelings of Loneliness Occur to Us All - Sometimes we are thrown into that sense of uniqueness and the awareness that no-one can ever fully know and understand us. In fact, occasionally we may feel that we do not even understand ourselves! This is because we are constantly changing in response to the situations and relationships that we develop. We have to accept that feeling lonely is an occasional price we pay for being human. However, an ongoing sense of deep loneliness can bring on feelings of despair and depression that indicate a need to get help.\nThe avoidance of doing a task which needs to be done - postponing until tomorrow what can be done today. Procrastination not only affects a person's work, but also commonly involves feelings such as guilt, inadequacy, self-disgust, stress and depression. Often we try to disguise our avoidance by being very busy doing things that may be interesting, and even useful, but don't contribute towards the main goal - even doing something we normally hate - rather than writing, for example, just before an essay deadline!\nDo you sweat as the date of your examination approaches? Is your concern or worry, about how the next few days will be as exams approach, causing you to under-perform?Well then you might be experiencing what is reffered to as Examination Stress.Examination Stress is an uneasiness or apprehension experienced before, during, or after an examination. It is very common among college and university students. But some students find that this interferes with their learning to such an extent that it can reduce the efficiency of performance so that results emerge lower than they should, and when anxiety begins to affect exam performance it has become a problem.\nMany students coming to college, and maybe leaving home for the first time, feel homesick. Even those who didn't ever expect to be hit by homesickness can suddenly find themselves missing the familiarity of home and friends, and don't know quite how to cope with the resulting emotions. This is entirely normal and passes, usually in the first term, and often within the first few weeks.It is really important to realize that you are not the only one feeling homesick and that it doesn't in any way mean you are inadequate. Suddenly, you find that, instead of being a central person in a small unit with plenty of peripheral activities and friends, you have become an anonymous member of a four thousand plus community where you know no-one. Understandably you feel shaken and lonely and you long for the secure and the familiar. Sometimes the emotions are completely overwhelming.\nRelationship or marital problems come in all shapes and sizes. So, If you're feeling distraught, worn out or desperate for help then please remember that you are not alone, and you are now in the right place.As a qualified and experienced couple counsellor I have been with many individuals and couples who have experienced these feelings. My expert knowledge has allowed me to help them to understand how and why they are struggling. They learned how to deal with their problems, solve them and move forward.\nComing to one of the best engineering institutes just after your schooling can be exhilarating, challenging and sometimes unsettling. For most of you it's probably the first time you are going away from your home and your family to face the world outside. It may take few days to adjust with the entirely new environment here, including the academics, food, interaction with seniors and most importantly with your batch-mates. As an undergraduate student, most of you will be allotted a two-seater room for first couple of years. So it becomes really significant how you go on with your friends especially your room-mate.It may happen that initially you don't feel comfortable with your friends, especially your room-mate, due to various reasons like language problem, different lifestyle or anything of that sort. Don't worry, as it is quite natural in the beginning. But you have to understand that you all are living here in a common fraternity and things will go better eventually as you start understanding your partner. It would be unfair to expect anyone to change their ways to suit you without you doing the same. The initial days requires a bit of tolerance from your side and you need to adjust. Even if things don't work out, it's much easier to unravel the problem by discussing it with your partner or with your friends rather than keeping it to yourself and unnecessarily getting tensed and ruining your health. You are mature enough to decide your preferences and conflict with others is definitely not one of them. Even then if you find it difficult, then, Counselling Service is always here to help you, to guide you. Do not hesitate to take proper guidance rather than indulging in trivial issues like conflict with others. Remember, you are here because you have the ability to grow and learn. Learning to work in a group and adapt to changing environment is one of the thing IITK would teach you. We are sure that you will make your parents and this institute proud."

    "content": "Currently, most of you must be doing a course or two related to your department and must have got a gist of what it is all about. Each department offers great opportunities in diverse fields and a research internship\n                                            will help you explore and know your department better.\nYou might be confused about where to apply or which field would be a good option. Generally, you are not expected to have an in-depth knowledge of a topic before asking professors for a summer project. A motivation\n                                            to learn and some interest is more than enough. It is a good idea to try out any field that fascinates you or maybe just sounds interesting.\nYour college is your first point of contact to the research world. You could talk to the professors in your department who are working in the area of your interest. Webpages of all the departments have a streamwise\n                                            list of the faculty along with their research interests. If you find the research work of some professor interesting, you should visit their homepage to find out more. It is a good idea to write a mail, expressing\n                                            your wish to work under their guidance during summers and asking for a time to meet them in their office. Although visiting their office directly might also work, but some professors consider it inappropriate.\nOur college offers a limited number of research grants for summer projects at IITK through the SURGE programme. A notification is issued by the mid of even semester giving details regarding the same.You should keep\n                                            an eye open for it.\nIt is also possible to apply other colleges and universities in India and abroad in a similar manner. However you need to keep in mind that not every professor who is offering you a project might be able to support\n                                            you financially. Do clarify this point in advance. A few funding programmes are open for 2nd year students, you could also apply to those. Indian Academy of Sciences also offers fellowships for research interns\n                                            at universities within India. You can visit their website for more details http://www.ias.ac.in/\nIt is worth reemphasizing that no prior research experience or skills are required to ask for a project from any professor. Do not shy away from talking to them. Even if they are not able to offer you an internship,\n                                            they might still give valuable advice and guidance.\nWe bring to you the next tip for utilising your summers fruitfully. This one is focussed on grooming your personality and there are a plethora of ways of which we list a few.\nReading books : Why read books??They help in improving not only your vocabulary but also your cognitive skills. Books help you to experience things that you may not have faced in real life and thus they help\n                                            you to expand your view of the world around. During the regular semester we do not get enough time to go through our course books (forget books of different genres :P). So summer is the best time. Some genres\n                                            that could be explored:\nSelf-help books: Eat That Frog - Brian Tracy, Who Moved my Cheese - Dr. Spencer Johnson, The Secret - Rhonda Byrne\nAutobiographies/Biographies: Surely, Youâre Joking Mr. Feynman - Richard Feynman, My Inventions - Nikola Tesla, Wings of Fire - APJ Abdul Kalam, The Man who Knew Infinity - Robert Kanigel\nScience Fiction: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, The Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams, Books by Isaac Asimov, Michael Crichton and H.G. Wells, Alchemist\nPopular Science: Books by Stephen Hawking, Fermatâs Enigma - Simon Singh, Logicomix - Apostolos Doxiadis, Cosmos - Carl Sagan, Freakonomics - Steven Levitt, Stephen Dubner\nHistory, Politics and General Knowledge: The Wonder that was India - A.L. Basham and a second volume by S.A.A Rizvi, India after Gandhi - Ramachandra Guha, India before Independence, India since Independence - Bipin\n                                            Chandra, Discovery of India, Glimpses of World History - Jawaharlal Nehru, Argumentative Indian-Amartya Sen\nBlog writing : Many of you are enthusiastic about expressing your views on politics, sports, education and what not! So blogging might be the way to go for you people. One important point that we would like\n                                            to emphasise is that you should not be nervous or self-consous about your writing when you decide to take up blogging. Have faith in your views and your ability to express them. This is the only way one can\n                                            learn to write.\nFollowing are a few major benefits of blogging:\nIt helps you to share your knowledge about any topic that you are passionate about. It may also aid you in finding more people who share your interest, and this is bound to widen your knowledge base. It also helps\n                                            you to refine your writing skills if you pursue it regularly. This is because you will receive feedback from your readers and along with it some praise is also sure to come by as you improve with time.\nNow, you might be wondering from where to start. Nowadays there are multiple online âhow to start a blogâ guides and online platforms such as Wordpress, Blogger, etc. So all you need to do is make your mind clear                                            on whether you really want to pursue it. If the answer is âyesâ then coming summer is the best time to nurture the âbloggerâ in you.\nGym/sports : Most of us think about getting on the treadmill once in a while. But due to our busy schedule from morning till evening during the regular semester, many of us do away with it. Hence, this is\n                                            the chance for all those aspiring âbodybuildersâ to get into proper shape.\n                                            Joining a gym (and going regularly :P) will allow you to spend each day with a proper time table. Who knows, sweating at the gym for a month or two might lead to a physique that you had always desired!\n                                            Apart from this, one should not forget the importance of playing outdoor\n                                            games. Summer is a good time to indulge in your favourite sport. We are all aware why sports are important. But most of us do not have a habit of playing regularly and that is either due to lack of interest\n                                            or due to lack of time or weâre too tired after our daily routine to exert ourselves anymore than absolutely necessary.This is where we need to change ourselves. Just do away with your electronic gadgets and\n                                            come out in the summer evenings with your friends and play any sport. We are sure you will not\n                                                mind having a\n                                                physically fit body along with those moments of\n                                                arguments, joy, fun and team spirit!\nEnglish writing and speaking skills : There would be many of you who would love to have a fluent spoken English. As mentioned above, blogging can help you to improve your writing skills. Reading books, newspapers,\n                                            articles and watching good TV shows/movies can help you build your vocabulary and structure your sentences better.\nAt the end we would like to mention that none of the ways mentioned above would have been unknown to you. Galileo once wrote,\nâYou cannot teach a person something he does not already\n                                                know; you can only\n                                                bring what he does know to his awareness.â\nHence we aimed to bring these points to your awareness so that you give your personality grooming a thought as it always matters in every sphere of life.\nThe next tip we bring you is about acquiring some a set of useful skills, which is yet another great way to spend your summers. They could range from technical skills such as coding to inter-personal skills such as strong communication\n                                and team-work. Itâs a great idea to start developing and sharpening these skills be it at the IITK campus or at home.\n                                Algorithmic and logical thinking has nowadays become a quintessential skill and is demanded of engineers and scientists. Programming is a good way to hone that skill. There are various tutorials that can be found\n                                online for almost all the major languages (Java, C, HTML, python, MATLAB etc.) and you can take up any one of these. We are providing some referral links for these such as\nApp and web development (using CSS/Java etc.) is certainly another area to look out for! Also, if youâre interested in design, learning Photoshop or\n                                Dreamworks will be a good choice. You may also have interests in a lot of subjects that are not offered in the campus. There are courses that are offered online. You can take these up deciding upon your interests\n                                setting your own pace of learning. These online\n                                courses also come with an official recognition. A few popular sites for online courses are Coursera, edX and NPTEL.\nCertain clubs and organisations (SAE/Aeromodelling Club/ Robotics Club/RuTag/GSoC) of IITK also offer interesting projects which help you to learn technical skills and let you dirty your hands on real life problems. You can\n                                contact the club coordinators for more information. You may also look out for courses and projects by departmental societies (such as ACA). These skills that you acquire in your summers will certainly be something that\n                                you may like to boast about in your resumes. And you never know, some of them might actually help you in your life in general!\nSo enjoy your summers and be productive!\nWhat would be one of the most casual yet productive ways of spending your summer vacations? It would be learning something new while your stay at home, or even if you are staying at campus for that matter; typically something\n                                that has nothing to do with your career choices or long term goals but rather a skill that you always postponed to 'some day...'. These are activities that aren't too much of a burden for your brain and fit perfectly in\n                                the theme of holidays and relaxing.\nIt surely would be fruitful in its own unique way, when one day you play guitar for a handful of audience and surprise them with the skills hidden up your sleeve or when you make a new dish for your family. It doesn't only\n                                improve your personality considerably, but also makes for an excellent hobby.\nYou can learn anything that you feel like â a musical instrument, cooking, gardening or a new language. These are skills that you start off by hit-and-trial (if your mom lets you do the trials in the kitchen that is!) With\n                                the aid of some tutorials, you will start to progress and would be quite good at the end of the holidays if you show a small amount of consistency. If you have tiniest of desire for learning performing arts, it would be\n                                a fantastic idea to go for many a summer programs offered by Gurukuls, across India. You may check out\n                                http://chinmayanaadabindu.org/ or http://www.swaminarayangurukul.org/. With the serene environment\n                                of the Gurukul along with its sublime guru-shishya parampara, get ready for an ethereal and life lasting experience.\nBut even if you can not make it, do not get disheartened! Make internet your school. The tutorial for any musical instrument or cooking can be easily found on youtube. Some instrument specific links are available on Online\n                                College Courses ( http://www.onlinecollegecourses.com/2012/10/07/30-great-places-to-learn-a-new-instrument-online/                                ). Also, Weekend Gardener (http://www.weekendgardener.net/how-to.htm) provides comprehensive how-to's of gardening. Some handy go-to places for learning\n                                a new language are BBC languages (http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/index.shtml), Duolingo (https://www.duolingo.com/)\n                                or Babbel (https://www.babbel.com/) - the latter two also have apps available.\nYou can also go for other new activities, for example, working in NGOs/ volunteering , such as Smile Foundation, Nanhi kali, Teach for India, Goonj, GiveIndia and HelpAge India. You will be amazed at the novelty of the experience\n                                from a volunteering work. The feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is truly priceless when you see that your actions are helping others, making an impact in their lives and bringing smiles to their faces.\n\n                                Today, all of us are so goal-oriented that we ignore all the dimensions of life that seem to have nothing to do with our career paths. But these 'miscellaneous' activities help us grow in their own unique way and are fundamental\n                                    for our all around development.\nToday, all of us are so goal-oriented that we ignore all the dimensions of life that seem to have nothing to do with our career paths. But these 'miscellaneous' activities help us grow in their own unique way and are fundamental\n                                    for our all around development.\nAs emphasised in the first mail, summers can be a great\n                                time to explore. Most of you, in your second year, might be confused about your future\n                                goals. You might\n                                find yourself unable to decide whether you wish to go for a research, or jobs in core\n                                    or non-core\n                                    sector. In such a case, you should explore as many of these avenues as\n                                possible\nAn intern in a startup can be an interesting and exciting learning\n                                experience.

The work\n                                freedom that start-ups provide can be your chance to pitch and work on your own\n                                ideas.\nStartup Internship Program or SIP, an initiative by E-cell IITK,\n                            is oriented towards providing internships by start-ups for 2nd and\n                                3rd year students.

The list of courses comes some time after the end of the pre-registration for the odd semester.  Doing courses in summer has multiple advantages, to list a few:\n                                \n\n\n                                            If you are interested in a topic/subject which you wish to pursue or just explore (Computational Fluid Dynamics/ Signal Processing/ Topology/ Linguistics etc.), then doing  a related course is the\n                                            best way to gauge your interest.

Here, we bring you few tips which will initiate you into the process.\nFor civil services examination, you can start exploring the syllabus and\n                                the reference\n                                books . For that, you may look up some sites where you can get some insight about where\n                                to begin and\n                                hear from the exam toppers. Some well known sites for IAS preparation are \nhttp://mrunal.org/,\n                            http://www.insightsonindia.com/, https://unacademy.in/.\n                                 Moreover, as reading newspapers regularly is one of the most important\n                                aspects of the\n                                preparation, inculcating this habit will be a good start.\nIf you are aiming for CAT, then you could study vocabulary as it is the section which mainly bothers engineers. In second year summers, you can explore the\n                                syllabus and you may even start\n                                preparing from prep books which contain questions on analytical reasoning. You may even consider joining coaching classes during summers, which have a flexible timetable which suits your needs. These coaching classes\n                                focus on English, quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning and data interpretation.\n                                 We hope you’ll have a productive and creative summer ahead!\nHey all!\nWe feel that by the time this mail comes to you, many of you must have started applying for the various opportunities that can capture you for the coming summer. However, there must be many more of you who would love to be in a wonderworld, maybe just\n                                for those 3 months, and obviously, why not?! Well, it is called a summer\n                                “break” for a\n                                reason!\n Ever thought of cutting yourself off from the wires around?? Relax a bit! Rest your brain - sleep, watch television, or just go around the town if that is what it takes to\n                                re-boost your\n                                energy before you start your next semester afresh. Enjoy the time off!\n                                 Do you wonder about those “family times”which we all cherish but work always messes it all up? Now is the time. Going back home should be thought of as a vacation. Visit your grandparents. Talk\n                                to them. They surely would have a lot to offer.And then there are those trips you always wanted to do...maybe bungee jumping even! Plan a vacation. Doesn’t need to be a five star resort; just a place with\n                                the people you love. Who knows spending some time at a monastery might change how you see life completely! And if you cannot travel to the exotic places to strike them off your bucket list, you could even explore your own\n                                city. Go to places you have always wished to but couldn’t as the next day you would have some quiz or an assignment due or had to study for the upcoming exams! Surely, your city would have its own niches and unchartered\n                                territories.\n                                \nThis time should be taken as one with no expectation. It is all right if you do not want to deal with  the stress that the world gives you. Take a moment. Think. And then decide what is best for you to\n                                do this summer and how important and helpful it actually is to take up something just because Mr. Sharma’s son is doing it too!\n                                 So, this ends of our mail series, and we wish the best for you this summer. Get\n                                up and try\n                                something that you wanted to for a long time or just sit back and chill out! Be it an internship, a summer course, a sports camp, a blog you start, a language you learn or the much needed sleep you complete in this\n                                summer.\n                                Just enjoy whatever you take up! Cheers!!\nEach course carries a weightage in terms of credits depending upon the number of contact hours per week (lectures and tutorials and/or laboratory hours).\r\n                                \nLecture: 3 credits per hour\nTutorial: 2 credits per hour\nlaboratory: 1 credits per hour\n\r\n                                For e.g. ESC101A is comprised of three 1-hour lectures, one 1-hour tutorial and one 3-hour laboratory per week.
